## Design Principles

In designing a *Minimum Viable Not-for-profit / politics Moloch*, we borrowed greatly from the Moloch v2 design as well as the OpenLaw LAO that emphasizes simple Solidity scripts for voting and other member transactions, largely relying on off-chain coordination to scale membership and deliver funding to grantees who will advance the DAO's mission. Like the LAO, we will give organizations the opportunity to further imbue a PeepsDAO's actions with legal effect through smart agreements, regular old contracts, and standard organizational documents in a way that can fit relatively easily into existing organizational structures or allow the members of a PeepsDAO to formalize their organization with a proxy-entity organized under 501(c) or 527 of the US tax code.

NB: This code is still under development and provided without warranty. We designed the Peeps DAO to work well with organizations that are (or wish to be) organized under 501(c) or 527 of the tax code, however, you should still speak to an attorney about the requirements and any on-goinging compliance obligations associated with doing such. If you instead chose to YOLO, godspeed and good luck.
